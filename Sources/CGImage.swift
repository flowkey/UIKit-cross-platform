     The second parameter provides the compressed image source data (in PNG, JPG etc. format). The source data will be used to recreate the `GPU_Image` if the GLContext has been invalidated (which happens quite commonly on Android). Not providing source data means you will have to recreate the `CGImage` yourself if it fails to render, usually by overriding your `CALayer`'s display() method.
